A desolate and twisted forest on the outskirts of the Shire, bathed in an otherworldly, sickly green glow. The gnarled branches of the trees reach towards the sky like skeletal fingers, their twisted forms creating a haunting canopy overhead. The ground is covered in a layer of eerie mist, creating an unsettling sense of unreality.
